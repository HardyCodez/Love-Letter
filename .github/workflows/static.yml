                Dear Olivia,<br>
                I present this web page from learning how to code and a little bit of boredom, also because I wanted to give you this message.
            </p>
                <p>
                   <h4>It's been a great 5 months and 20 days since i've first laid my eyes on you. The first day when we did so much together, from games at Dave N Busters to watch Scream, and finally hanging with you and being at my first party. I will always remember this day as a wonderful start to our journey together. 
                    From this day I knew we had something special going on and I was already set on being with you for the rest of my life. I said this before and I'll say it a million times again, you are perfect to me and is all I have ever wanted in a person. I want to treat you like a queen because that is what you are to me, I want try and give you the life you've always wanted because I want to make you happy. One of the most special days of my life is your 18th birthday which I got to tell you "I love you" which is something I had wanted to say for a while but I wanted to tell you on your birthday as a gift. If you ever need someone to talk I am here for you as I will always be and if I ever need someone to talk to you'll be that person.
